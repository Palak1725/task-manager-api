- User-friendly endpoints with JSON responses
- Input validation and error handling
- MySQL integration for persistent storage
- Modular blueprint-based structure
- Basic authentication (upcoming)

## 🧠 Learning Goals
- Understand how scalable backend services are designed
- Explore REST architecture and request handling
- Practice database modeling and API data flow
- Write clean, reusable, maintainable code


## 📦 Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- MySQL
- Postman (for testing)

## 🧩 Status
🛠️ Currently under development. Expect updates soon.
